Personally speaking, for entrepreneurs, great satisfaction comes from the process of creation -- starting with just an idea and building something that lasts. There is pride of ownership from seeing your family name on the company. Successfully facing challenges and as a result finding skills and strengths you didn’t think you had -- these are definitely aspects of personal success in business.
Financially speaking, successful businesses earn a substantial return on investment for the shareholders who risked their capital in the venture. The founders of the company, who are generally also shareholders, are able to create wealth for their families and security for their future, as well as enjoy a more affluent lifestyle. They measure success by being able to provide a better life for their children than they had when they were young.
Socially speaking, companies also measure success by the good they accomplish for society. Some have specific social goals, such as improving the environment or providing educational opportunities for children through the products and services they offer. Others have a very high commitment to charitable giving and being good corporate citizens. Film star Paul Newman’s company, Newman’s Own Inc., which manufactures and markets a variety of consumer products, distributes all of its after tax profits to charitable causes. The company’s charitable foundation has donated more than $300 million, according to Newman's Own website.
With the number of businesses that fail or start out strong only to stumble in the competitive marketplace a few years later, another measure of business success is the ability to sustain success in the turbulent, ever changing business world. Book publisher John Wiley & Sons began in 1807 as a small New York City-based printing shop. Two hundred years later, in 2007, the company’s revenues were more than $1 billion, according to the company's website. The company has been able to successfully adapt to changes in readers’ taste but also to the technological changes in the publishing industry -- for more than two centuries.
Customer Satisfaction -> Helping customers solve a problem -- that’s the reason many of the products and services we use every day were created. For business owners, seeing that your products made your customers lives better in a significant way is one of the motivating factors that keeps them working tirelessly on developing even better solutions. Praise from satisfied customers provides a feeling of accomplishment that for some business owners is as important as the financial rewards they earn.
Employee Satisfaction -> “Fortune" magazine publishes an annual list of what it considers the 100 best companies to work for, but thousands of business owners don’t need national media recognition to know that they have made taking good care of their employees a high priority. They see it in how hard their employees work, how committed each member of their team is to the organization’s goals. They measure this aspect of business success in how many employees stay with the company for five or 10 years or more -- sometimes their whole career.
